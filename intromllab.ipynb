    "Throughout the lab we'll be working with a digitized version of a band gap dataset compiled by two scientists, W.H. Strehlow and E.L. Cook. They compiled this dataset of elementary and binary compound semiconductors in 1973 by searching through 723 individual references. Along with simply compiling reported measurements they also took the time to identify more and less reliable data points by taking \"into consideration the material, the method of measurement, the reported sample purity, and the experimental conditions.\" They also comment that experimental measures are often greater than 5% in error and seldom less than 1%. \n",

    "Having access to a dataset such as this is a great place to start for machine learning. In this case band gap data has been generated over many years, and often times the first step in any machine learning problem is simply acquiring the data. Luckily Strehlow and Cook have done the largest part of the work for us already! So now let's think about how we might want to use the data that we have. We'll focus on two potential applications for our machine learning models, which will give us something to call back to when we want to decide how well the models are performing\n",

    "### Predicting Materials for Single-Junction Solar Cells\n",
    "Solar power is growing as a renewable energy source and there are two main factors that could improve it's viability when competing with other sources of energy. First is the cost of manufacturing materials, and the second is the efficiency of the Solar Cells themselves. If cost could be lowered via the discovery of new materials that are cheaper, and the efficiency of cells can be improved by finding materials with ideal band gaps, then solar energy could grow faster! So lets set our first goal as being a model that can predict potential solar materials based on their band gap. For simplicity we'll limit ourselves to single-junction cells, which allows us to more clearly define an operational range of band gaps. Following the suggestions from the links below (which cover things in much greater detail), in order to obtain reasonable efficiency in a single-junction solar cell we would need a material with a band gap in the range of 1.0 eV to 1.7 eV. In order to make predictions in this range then, we would need a model with an accuracy of +- 0.35 eV at the most to give us a shot and having predictions actually be within that range. \n",
    "\n",
    "For a more thorough background see the following:\n",

    "### Predicting Wide Band Gap Semi-conductors\n",
    "There are also a range of semi-conductor devices that are relatively less well known which fall under the category of Wide Band Gap semi-conductors (WBG). A few example devices would be in industrial motors where they can improve efficiency, in LED lighting and lasers, and in general electronics. Several properties of WBGs that give these device improvements are their higher voltage, temperature, and frequency operation ranges. For a more thorough discussion see the linked review! So again if we can build a model to predict WBG materials, we can potentially accelerate development of these next generation devices. Our criteria for predicting WBG materials will be having a bandgap between 2 eV and 4 eV. whereas more traditional semi-conductors have band gaps below 2 eV. That means for predicting WBG materials we need a model with an accuracy of +- 1 eV!\n",

    "\n",
    "1) Index   \n",
    "When dealing with large datasets having an explicit index is essential for keeping track of data points. Throughout the lab we'll be making changes to the dataset, and without proper indexing it's easy to make mistakes and lose track of where data came from.\n",
    "By Specifying a unique number to each datapoint we can always track things down to troubleshoot, make later changes, or track where something came from.\n",

    "2) chemicalFormula Clean  \n",
    "This is the key input parameter for all of the models you'll build. Fundamentally all of the information that the model contains can be represented by the chemical formulas in this column. \n",
    "Take a second to think about how powerful it would be to have a model that only has these simple letters and numbers as input. With an accurate model it would be possible to think of any composition of interest and obtain an almost immediate prediction.\n",

    "Carrying on from the previous thought we have to ask ourselves \"what is it that we're predicting?\". In this case we have a dataset of band gap values for semiconductors and insulators. Knowledge of a material's bandgap is essential for a whole range of semiconductor applications.\n",
    "If we could predict a new material's band gap we could potentially accelerate discovery and design of materials, contributing to what is already more than a 400 billion dollar industry!\n",
    "\n",
    "4) Band gap method  \n",
    "We won't dive too deeply into the method information here directly, but notice that in the dataset we have a few different experimental measurement types. This is often the case when putting together large datasets that not all data is exactly equal. \n",
    "The accuracy of a model is often limited by the quality of data availabe so it's always important to understand where are the data comes from, and if it can be combined.\n",
    "\n",
    "5) Reliability  \n",
    "As a simpler version of the idea above about data quality we have a column labeled \"Reliability\". The researcher who put the dataset together took time to check each of their sources and come up with a reliability score or 1 or 2. \n",
    "A score of 1 indicates the most reliable data, and a 2 indicates that the samples may have been less pure, or the experimental technique was less accurate. As part of the data cleaning process later on we'll only use the most reliable data we have."

    "The first five rows of this table show the same chemical formula \"Li1F1,\" which means the dataset lacks diversity in this particular attribute. For training a machine learning model, such a feature does not provide enough variability to learn the relationships and differences between different chemical formulas effectively. This lack of diversity can lead to poor generalization of the model, making it unable to accurately predict and analyze new, different chemical formulas. Therefore, we need a more diverse set of chemical formulas to train the machine learning model effectively."

The std measures the dispersion of these band gap values, and a std of 2.287 eV indicates a relatively large degree of dispersion of data points around the mean. Taking these two statistical measures into consideration, a 5 eV error is equivalent to more than twice the mean value, and it is also a significant proportion of the standard deviation. This suggests that the error value has a relatively large level of variation compared to the band gap values. Therefore, from a statistical perspective, a 5 eV error is considered relatively large in relation to the band gap values in the dataset;\n",
    "\n",
    "3. An error of 0.5 eV represents approximately 22.4% of the mean value of 2.231 eV. In the context of the standard deviation of 2.287 eV, this error accounts for about 21.9% of the standard deviation. This indicates that a prediction error of 0.5 eV is relatively small. According to the statistics, 25% of the Band gap values Clean are less than 0.695 eV, and 75% are less than 3.000 eV. Therefore, an error of 0.5 eV appears reasonable within the range of most data points."

    "\n",
    "1. According to the histogram polt, we have more data in 0–4 than 5–12. It appears to be right-skewed or positively skewed, meaning that there are more data points at lower band gap values, and the frequency of data points decreases as band gap values increase. Thus, it is not uniformly distributed across its range and our band gap data is not balanced.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Given the imbalance in the band gap data distribution, we would not expect the model to have similar performance between the 0-2 eV range and the 10-12 eV range. Since there are more data points in the lower band gap range (0-2 eV), the model would likely have more data to learn from in that range and may perform better there. Conversely, in the 10-12 eV range, where there are fewer data points, the model may have limited examples to learn from, potentially leading to lower performance in that range."

This featurization step is necessary to turn the text representation of materials into a numerical representation that the models can understand! In order to make this notebook independent from outside code versioning as much as possible, we'll use pre-generated features using the MAST-ML code package instead of generating them in real time in this notebook. Though the features used are from a previous version of MAST-ML which generated a list of \"composition average elemental properties\" to represent each unique material.\n",

    "2. You shouldn't be overly concerned about having too few useful features, as columns with constant values typically don't provide any information about the data in machine learning models and may even have a negative impact on model performance. Therefore, removing these columns with constant values is typically part of data preprocessing to improve model efficiency and performance. In some cases, reducing the number of features can also lower model complexity and prevent overfitting. However, it's important to ensure that a sufficient number of relevant and informative features are retained for the model to make accurate predictions. Therefore, the key is to ensure that the feature selection process is carefully considered to find the most relevant and useful features."

    "\n",
    "2. After filtering for highly correlated features, there is a potential concern about having too few useful features left in the dataset. Removing highly correlated features is a common data preprocessing step to reduce multicollinearity and enhance the interpretability and performance of machine learning models. However, it should be done carefully. If a large number of features were highly correlated and were subsequently removed, it's possible that the remaining set of features may be insufficient to capture the complexity of the underlying data. This could lead to a loss of important information, reduced model expressiveness, and potentially poorer predictive performance. Therefore, it's essential to strike a balance between removing redundant or correlated features and retaining enough relevant features to build an effective predictive model. Careful feature selection and domain knowledge can help ensure that the final feature set is both informative and manageable for the machine learning task at hand."

    "We can test the model by asking it to predict the bandgap value of materials, compare it with measured values, and calculate its prediction error using a range of error metrics (e.g. RMSE, R2, etc), but the naive approach of training and testing the model using the same dataset gives us a <u>biased estimate</u> of model error because the model has *seen* all the data we are asking it to predict already.  \n",
    "\n",
    "To get an <u>unbiased estimate</u> of model error, we can employ a simple <u>cross-validation</u> technique: Setting aside a subset of data as our <u>test set</u>, which the model won't access during the training process. The rest of the data constitutes the <u>training set</u>, which is used to train the model. This allows us to then evaluate model performance by comparing model prediction on both seen data (training set) and unseen data (test set).\n",

    "1. Explain how model evaluation is tied directly to ML application\n",

    "As one last motivation as we start asssessing our model, lets predict two band gaps of materials you're probably familiar with, Silicon and Silica. Silicon is used in practically every electronic device as a semiconductor, and Silica is basic window glass. You can look up the values of their band gaps fro reference, but look how just in a few lines of code the model can already give us a rough idea of their values. We know Silicon is a semi-conductor and it's bandgap should be fairly low, while the band gap for Silica has to be much higher because window glass shouldn't absorb any light at all. Based on these predictions it seems like the model can already pick up on these trends! But as we've been mentioning, just making a few select predictions is not a good way to measure overall performance, in the next sections we'll dig into more robus ways to measure the performance!"

It's important to note that this is just one choice we could make for assigning an error bar to the model's predictions. There are other, more complex methods for generating error bars for model predictions, and we're going to ignore those for now in favor of simplicity.

    "\n",
    "In the previous section, we evaluated the performance of a default model based on its performance in predicting a single set of test data. While this model predicted the training data almost perfectly, predictions of the testing data showed significantly worse performance. This combination of a model that perfectly reproduces training data, but can't predict data it hasn't seen is a classic sign of <u>overfitting</u>. One way to address this issue to to try to alter the hyperparameters of the model.\n",
    "\n",
    "When building our first model we used default settings from the `scikit-learn` package, we can attempt to improve the performance by optimizing the <u>hyperparameters</u> of a model (think of them as *tunable knobs*). \n",
    "\n",
    "This will be the penultimate task in this lab, before we select a final model and make predictions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Remember that a machine learning model has two types of parameters:  \n",
    " - The first are the regular <u>parameters</u> of the model. These would be the coefficients in the case of a linear model; in the case of the decision tree, they are the nodes that get generated when the model is fit, and we don't set them directly.  \n",
    " - The second are the <u>hyperparameters</u>. These are the variables that we adjust to change how the model learns and how it gets fit. For example, for decision trees, we can limit how complex and large the tree can be by setting a number of hyperparameters including the maximum tree depth and the maximum leaf nodes. We can also increase the number of trees that we train and make a model that is an average prediction of these multiple trees.  \n",
    "\n",
    "In this lab, we'll focus in on one hyperparameter specifically called <i>n\\_estimators</i> . Each estimator is one decision tree, and by using the RandomForestRegressor class from sci-kit-learn we can increase this number to build multiple individual trees which will all try to predict our bandgaps. Taking average results from multiple decision trees can often improve model performance and reduces overfitting that can occur in a single decision tree.\n",

This type of assessment is nice as a final check of a model once the hyperparameters are set, however think about what would happen if we only used that single Test split as our method for assessment. The we could find the best model at predicting that specific subset of data, but not the model that is best at predicting all of our available data. To adress this we'll use a cross-validation strategy from scikit-learn called `RepeatedKFold` cross-validation. The main different is that instead of making a single split in the data we will make 'K' splits in the data and predict each of those in turn by training on the remaining data. This means every data point is used in both training and testing. The \"Repeated\" addition to the KFold method means that the process is repeated a number of times so that there are a total of \"K\" x \"Repeats\" splits in the model.

    "Before diving into the questions lets run a few different grid searches to get a feel for how it works. By default the notebook is setup with a very rough grid search which should run quickly. be careful adding too many grid points because it is possible to slow down the grid search to the point of not finishing in hours or days. As a rule of thumb lets not set number of trees to be above 100, and lets not include more than 10 individual grid points in any one search. Try to get a sense of how performance varies with number of trees. Before answering questions below set your grid to be [1,3,5,7,10,15,20,50] which should give a reasonable spread of values. As a reminder these edits are made in the section above \"defining a parameter space\" \n",

    "1. Looking just at the training data curve above, what is the number for `n_estimators` that gives the smallest MSE?\n",
    "2. How about for the validation data? Which value for `n_estimators` gives the smallest MSE?  \n",
    "3. Look at the trend in validation data. If n_estimators was increased beyond 50 do you think the model would change in performance significantly?  \n",
    "4. Do we expect the model get more complex as we increase the number of trees?  \n",
    "5. Looking at just the validation curve, does increasing number of trees seem to increase overfitting at any point on the curve? This would show up as worsening performance in the validation data as trees increase.\n",

    "In the final section of the lab we'll do one final test to gauge the model's performance. We've been trying throughout the lab to highlight the importance of keeping a model's use case in mind throughout the process and building and training. In our case we are focusing on two potential use cases. In predicting solar materials which require a bandgap between 1.1 and 1.7 eV, and wide bandgap materials which want a bandgap above 3 eV. \n",
    "\n",
    "In the more general sense, important questions to ask are things like:  \n",
    "1) what is the necessary accuracy for predictions I want to make? For example we've highlighted two use cases for our band gap model, one that requires a much more accurate model than the other.  \n",
    "2) What is the feature space I want to predict in (What compositions are we interested in predicting)? Our dataset is trained entirely on binary and elementary semiconductors. Making predictions outside of this space would be very risky as a lot of our error estimates might break down.\n",
