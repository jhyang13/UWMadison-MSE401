## Module 1: Basics of Machine Learning

https://bafflerbach.github.io/test_software_carpentry/01-MLbasics/index.html

### Objectives
- Students can describe the structure of several basic machine learning model types, the types of predictions that can be made, and metrics for assessing regression and classification performance.
- Students will practice using jupyter notebooks to execute machine learning workflows on cloud computing platforms which they can transfer to other projects.
- Students will assess model performance on two potential applications and justify which task the model is appropriate for.

## Module 2: Establishing Research Workflows

https://bafflerbach.github.io/test_software_carpentry/02-MASTMLbasics/index.html

### Objectives
- Using the MAST-ML software, students will execute common machine learning workflow steps: data cleaning, feature generation, feature engineering, model assessment through cross validation, model optimization, and model predictions.
- Students will compare error metrics from K-fold cross validation using different numbers of folds and assess the effects on reported error metrics.

## Module 3: Comparing Model Types

### Objectives
- Students will recreate workflows in MAST-ML from other machine learning software in (like Citrination or other base ML software packages like scikit-learn).
- Students will practice modifying the model type and hyperparameters within a machine learning workflow in MAST-ML by editing code in a Jupyter Notebook.
- Students will compare a random forest model that’s coded into the Jupyter Notebook to a model of their choice and assess the relative performance of the model types.

## Module 4: Optimizing Model Hyperparameters

https://bafflerbach.github.io/test_software_carpentry/04-Hyperopt/index.html

### Objectives
- Students learn about how model hyperparameters can affect performance and are introduced to some basic ideas on how these hyperparameters can be optimized, namely the grid search method.
- Students explore various methods of searching for a global minimum in model errors and avoiding getting trapped in a local minimum.
- Students run a neural network within MAST-ML. They can describe what they are, how to use them, and how to optimize them.
